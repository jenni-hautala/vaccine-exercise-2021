# Vaccine exercise 2021

Small web project using MERN stack. Shows vaccination data by selecting a date.

## Installation and running the application

The application is currently available only locally.

Run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app.

Applicaton will run on port: 3000, http://localhost:3000/

## Tips

- Run ```npm i``` and ```npm start``` separately if you're using PowerShell
- The application allows you to choose a date until the current day but try choosing dates in the beginning of the year. The data remains same after 12/04/2021

## Possible improvements for the future

- Server and client deployment

- Showing more data (For example expiring vaccines)

- Improvements for the UI:
	- Animations and other visual elements
	- Accessibility

- Implementing proper tests:
	- Browser testing on desktop and mobile
	- Finding possible bugs from data
